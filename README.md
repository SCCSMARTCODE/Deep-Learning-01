## Overview

This repository includes:
- **Segmentation**: Projects that involve the division of an image into segments to identify and analyze objects or areas.
- **Object Detection**: Projects focused on detecting and classifying objects within images or videos.
- **Object Tracking**: Projects that track objects in real-time from video feeds, leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms.

We utilize:
- **PyTorch**: A powerful deep learning library for building and training neural networks.
- **OpenCV**: A popular library for computer vision tasks such as image processing and video manipulation.
- **Ultralytics**: A framework known for the YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, commonly used in real-time object detection.
